# Introduction to data visualisation 

This folder contains a mini single page website which 
incorporates multiple p5.js sketches. The sketches introduce key technical concepts:

- The 'iframe' HTML tag with a 'style' attribute. 
- Use of inline JavaScript within HTML rather that seperate p5.js sketche.js files.  
- Connecting a quantative value to the visual display of an element. 
- Scaling a value so it displays within the view area. 
- Use of aligned arrays to store/retrieve data. 
- Interaction with HTML elements. 

To view the example using VScode right-click (windows) or ctrl-click (MacOS) the index.html file and select 'Open with Live Server'.
