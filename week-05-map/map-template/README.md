MA2806 CODE TEMPLATE
====================

This project is designed to act as a template for all the coding we will be doing in this module over the coming weeks. As you can see, there are multiple files in the project, but the main one that you will be working with is the file *sketch.js*. This is our Processing sketch file where we write our code. There is also *README.md* (this file!), and *index.html* (the webpage that loads and displays our Processing sketch).


Your Project
------------

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your project does and how you built it.

### ← index.html

You don't need to touch this, it's all set up for you to load the p5.js file and your sketch.js file. 

### ← sketch.js

This is where you should write your p5js code.
